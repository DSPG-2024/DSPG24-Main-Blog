    "text": "My identity\n\nCountry\nI, Tabassum Zaman, come from a Southasian country named “Bangladesh”. Which has got some amazing stories to tell people about itself to tell the world. But I will keep it short today to be focused on the objective of this blog.\n\n\n\n\nBangladesh with its surrounding countries\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of Dhaka city (capital of Bangladesh)\n\n\n\n\n\nAcamedics\nDepartment: Community and Regional Planning\nProgram: Masters\nInstitution: Iowa State University\nI completed my undergrad in ‘Urban and Regional Planning’ from my dream university in Bangladesh which was ‘BUET [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]’. I have been always interested in the Transportation problem surrounding me, may be because that’s all I saw. But with time as I am exploring more, I am finding my new interested areas in spatial problems like, housing, accessibility. I am hoping to be focused down in a very near future, as I finished up my semester of masters program this Spring 2024.\n\n\n\nMy Undergrad Convocation from BUET in Urban and Regional Planning\n\n\n\n\nWhat got me into Data Science\nAfter completing my undergrad I had the opportunity to work in the real world for more than a couple of years, in transportation, health care and commodity industry back home. There I got to know the power of data and story telling. You can influence decision through your stories but it has to be backed by data and presented in a comprehensible format and your one little presentation can really changes lives. I can go on giving a number of examples to show how it has motivated me, but I will stop here, and keep my Focus.\nSo, my encounter of Data Science is through excel (you can do a lot of stuff there too) and for spatial one if through GIS (Geographic Information System). I know some basics of SQL, R, Python, but not enough to score good in quiz. But I am betting on my time here and the aim is to have the most productive time this summer 2024 and see the result after 10 weeks. I will come back to share the updates!\n\n\nMy Leisure\nI do not really have any particular talents apart from the academics one, but apart from sleep and watching tv, I love a good conversation of getting to know new people, good food, some cooking, travelling, a little bit of gardening and reading fictions. Pretty ordinary things!"

As I embark on the DSPG program, I seek to improve my leadership and mentoring capabilities, alongside acquiring new technical expertise. An important goal for me is to refine my communication skills to effectively convey data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, I aim to master the management and extraction of value from extensive real-world datasets, leveraging these skills to make impactful decisions and contributions.\nIn my leisure time, I enjoy listening to music, watching soccer games and playing video games.\n\n\nWhy I Care about Data Science\nI remember the moment I became interested in advanced research in Data Science. It was during my master’s research, where I evaluated the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on chronic kidney disease (CKD). I used propensity score matching to address differences in patient characteristics that might influence SGLT2 prescription. Additionally, I utilized machine learning models to predict CKD cases. Since the dataset was imbalanced, I applied balanced bagging with bootstrapping and synthetic minority oversampling to balance the distribution of CKD and non-CKD cases in the training data. This aimed to facilitate improved learning on the training dataset and enhance predictions on the testing data. The analysis revealed that individuals taking SGLT2 had fewer CKD cases than those who did not, highlighting the protective effect of SGLT2 on CKD. This shows the potential of statistics and data science in extracting meaningful insights from healthcare data.\nHowever, amidst this revelation, a significant issue surfaced - the absence of reliable data for marginalized populations, resulting in disproportionately worse health outcomes. Since then, my focus evolved from merely using models to make predictions to understanding the “why” and “what-if” behind those predictions. I realized that relying solely on supervised models was insufficient for this purpose, prompting me to develop methods that could integrate machine learning and causal approaches to address and explain predictions in imbalanced datasets.\n\n\n\nFigure Reference (Causality for Machine Learning)\n\n\nAs a consequence, I aim to leverage machine learning with causal methods to understand the influence of policies and interventions on diseases outcomes across various data sources. I seek to move from prediction-based models to learning independent causal models in areas like transfer and meta-learning. This approach will aid in integrating diverse healthcare datasets, often compounded by heterogeneous patient characteristics and medical protocols, ensuring the generalizability of my findings against external datasets. Additionally, I aim to create models capable of scaling up datasets to better reflect the diversity of the population. My goal is to enhance model interpretability through counterfactual reasoning and mitigate algorithmic biases for fair and equitable outcomes, ensuring the reliability of healthcare research across different demographics."

    "text": "The basics\n\n\n\nI am originally from Tennessee, but moved to Iowa so I could attend Iowa State.\n\n\n\nI will enter my 3rd year at Iowa State this fall.\n\n\n\nI am currently majoring in data science and linguistics. I enjoy studying data science because I like learning about how I can take data and apply code in order to learn new things about how the world works. I am studying linguistics because I enjoy it, and hope someday to work on NLP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy goals\n\n\n\nAs I stated above, I would love to work on NLP. In addition, I hope to use my degrees to help people, so that the world becomes a better place because I was in it.\n\n\n\nI care about data science because it’s fun. It might be selfish of me, but I don’t think I would care half as much if I didn’t enjoy the puzzle of figuring out what code and formulas need to be inputted in order to find a solution.\n\n\n\nI don’t have much experience working solely in data science, but I am currently in a computational linguistics lab. I have also worked in a computational biochemical lab with a focus on using AI for predictive modeling of protein synthesis. In both of those labs, I routinely used Excel or Python to work with large data sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\n\n\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading, crochet, and foraging. It’s legal to forage wild plants on public land in Iowa, and there’s a lot of really interesting food not sold in stores. I find that searching for new plants to try is a good exercise both mentally, in terms of improving my knowledge of plant identification, and physically because I get to go out and explore nature!\n\n\n\nI’m very interested in learning - anything and everything is fun to learn about. I’ve spent hours in Parks Library’s stacks, getting lost in books on the history of Iowa State’s water system (the water system originally had slightly higher calcium levels than ideal. That book is in the highest stack and has a coupon for 99 cent pizza and a drink. Unfortunately, the coupon expired in 1995) or, if you look at the mining data on the 3rd stack, you can learn that Quebec produced 450 thousand tons of Asbestos in 1941. It’s so cool how much there is to learn in the stacks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills, Future Goals, and Looking Forward\n\n\n\nI appreciate my ability to stay calm in a crisis. Additionally, I think I’m good at working consistently on longer projects.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, I think I’m decent at determining potential trends in data before I work very much with it. I run into a lot of errors when I code, but that means I’ve become pretty good at debugging, which certainly isn’t the worst skill to have.\n\n\n\nI hope to broaden the scope of my python experience, better understand the specific methodologies and fields in which data science can be applied to improve the world, and improve my understanding of different data science software adn how they work together to form a project.\n\n\n\nI have skills in python, but the data I’ve worked with and the things I’ve done in the language aren’t quite the same as what I expect I will use during the course of this program.\n\n\n\nI want to better understand the industry and what part I could play.\n\n\n\nI plan to take detailed documentation on every process I follow (not so detailed that it distracts from the work, but detailed enough that I’ll be able to retrace my steps and better remember what I did).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End\n\n\nThank you for looking at my presentation.\n\n\nTo learn more about me, feel free to find my LinkedIn.\n\n\nOr, some of my coding projects are hosted on my GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly complex, I believe it is important to have tools that can explain this complexity in such a way that people who have to make decisions are able to fully understand the topics they’re making decisions about. I want to be someone who knows how to weild those tools in order to make the world a better place."

This is how I stumbled across the DSPG program and applied to be a graduate fellow for summer of 2022. I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello, My name is Cael Leistikow\n\nWhere are you from?\nI grew up in Frederika, Iowa which is about 30 minutes north of Waterloo and I attended New Hampton High School.\n\n\nWhat’s your current academic year?\nI am currently a Senior at Iowa State going into my fourth year with intentions of graduating next Spring.\n\n\nWhat degrees are you studying?\nI am majoring in Data science with a minor in Economics\n\n\nWhy did you choose your degrees?\nI chose these degree because I had always been fascinated by statistics, especially sports statistics, and as I went through high school I began to grow an interest in programming as well and when I discovered that Iowa State offered a degree that was a mixture of the two, I knew that it was what I wanted to pursue.\n\n\nWhat are your plans with your degree(s)?\nMy plans for after college is to use my degrees as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist within the business sector and having my Economics degree as well to be able to apply my knowledge towards making informative business decisions. After a few years I would consider to go for my dream job of working as a sports data analyst for a professional US sports team, preferably in baseball or football.\n\n\nWhy do you care about data science?\nI care about data science cause I firmly believe that it is the future towards optimizing and maximizing everything that we do in society. Everything that we do can be put into data and being able to understand how to work with and interpret that data is very valuable. Although it comes with a lot of power that can be manipulated if the owner so desires.\n\n\n\nDo you have any prior experience with data science?\nI have taken numerous data science courses here at Iowa State. I have had an internship with Kingland Systems as a Data Research Analyst. Finally, I have been a Statistician when I was playing under levels of athletics for the varsity team in high school.\n\n\nWhat kinds of extracurricular activities/hobbies do you care about?\nMy extracurricular activities are the Sports Analytics Club, Data Science Club, and Intramural sports.\nMy favorite hobbies are playing basketball, watching sports and going to games, hanging out with friends, listening to music, cooking, and travel.\n\n\nWhat do you want your peers to know about you?\n\nAn interesting fact about me is I have visited 24 of the 50 states as well as DC and Canada. Obviously I like to travel. My favorite trip being to Colorado. Additionally, my most desired place to travel next would be Hawaii as I haven’t gone outside on the intercontinental US or Canada.\n\n\nList some skills in data science that you feel you do well?\nI feel I do very well in data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning/modeling, R programming as it is my more preferred programming language, and finally SQL and database management.\n\n\nList at least three skills you would like to learn or develop during the DSPG program.\nI would like to develop during the DSPG program is AI development as AI is going to continue to integrated itself in everyday life. Another skill I would like to learn is GIS as I have seen a lot of employers looking for candidates who are able to effectively use GIS. Finally, the last thing I would like to learn is how the data science process works in a real-world scenario that I could then apply in the future.\n\n\nWhy are you pursuing these skills? Why do they matter to you?\nThe reason I’m pursuing these skills and why the matter to me is because I want to be able to put myself in the best position I can for when I’m beginning to look for my full-time career. Being a senior this coming year I need to refine and learn any skills that I can to help me stand out as a candidate to make sure I position myself for the job I want and to have a successful life.\n\n\nHow do you hope to improve these skills?\nI hope to learn and improve these skills through Datacamp as a tutorial for GIS or AI to help create a foundational understanding and then from there apply it to the projects to help use this knowledge on a real-world issue. Additionally, learning from the project leaders and the lunch talks during the program will help me see from other people’s perspective and ask questions to grow my understanding further."

I enjoy coming up with new ideas for solving problems. Not giving up on finding actually meaningful results that can have a postive impact.\n\n\n\nthree skills you want to develop\n\n\n\nPython and R are extremely important skills for data science and I have been working with the long enough to know how valuable they can be. I also really like using Tableau, I think it’s popular for a reason, for being as high level as it is it can do some pretty complex things such as being able to use SQL to manipulate data while in tableau.\n\n\n\nwhy these skills?\n\n\n\nI’m pursuing these skills because I believe they are the best tools for data sciences to become successful. It’s a safer bet to say that in Python and R will still be relevant in 10 years but some of the higher level skills may be replaces by ai or somethings even higher level.\n\n\n\nhow are you going to improve skills?\n\n\n\nWork on them everyday. The more I work with these technologies the more comfortable I will get with them overtime and the faster I can get things done with them."

    "text": "Linking Pages and Images\nYou can link items in your files by using the following syntax [Text of Link](Link Reference - URL). Referencing also works for adding images into your blogs. The syntax is very similar, but requires an ! in the front. So an example would be ![Stock Photo of a Data Cat](imgs/Data_Cat.png)\n\n\n\nStock Photo of a Data Cat\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image in the yaml, the first image in the post will be used as the thumbnail of the post. A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "title": "Blog Writing Guidelines",
    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

RMarkdown files have the ability to change the rendering engine so that other languages can also be used. To run Python, you will have to have the reticulate library installed and configured. When you’ve created a code chunk, you will want to switch the section that is typically in the form of {r} to {python} or whatever other supported language you wish to use.\nHere is a Python code block.\n\nimport platform\n\nprint(\"This code is run using python version\", platform.python_version())\n\nThis code is run using python version 3.9.18"

Subsequently, we applied various techniques that I learned during the Data Camp sessions. For instance, we implemented Sobel edge detection to highlight edges within the image. we also explored morphological operations to produce an eroded version of the image, which helps in understanding structural elements. Additionally, we generated a gray-scale histogram to analyze the intensity distribution and applied a global threshold to segment the image based on intensity values.\nEdge Detection:\n\nContour and Object Extracted:\n\n\nWe have provided the github link to Image-Processing Activity : https://github.com/NehaTiru/Image_Processing/blob/main/Untitled2.ipynb"

The idea is we want to be gather data at the smallest level we can with hopes of going down to the household level if possible. To do this we looked at two communities of varying sizes to see what level of data is available, Des Moines and Clear Lake.\nStarting with population density this week, we started off at the city level using Census data from the ACS-5 year (2022) to make sure data was available and the results are displayed in the graph below.\n\nSource: US Census ACS-5 (2022)\nFrom there we moved on to see if data was available at the block group and block level, which data was found for population but coming up with density would be a bit time intensive especially in Des Moines. Below is the population density of the block groups in Clear Lake as well as the block layout of Des Moines in which the process of getting population density would be similar yet time consuming.\nClear Lake Block Group Population Density\n Source: US Census ACS-5 (2022)\nDes Moines Block Population\n Source: Us Census 2020 Decennial Data\n\n\n#|echo = FALSE\npopulation_elderly2 &lt;- readRDS(file = \"Data/populationElderly2.RDS\")\n\n\nMoving forward we could look into remote sensing as a possibility to get even smaller data using machine learning. Similar to research that was done at the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology for finding population density in Beijing City.\nFor More Information: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/12/1910\n\nSources:\n\nThe demographic statistical atlas of the united states—Statistical atlas.

    "text": "Social & Cultural Capitals\n\nBeginning\nThroughout this week we have been brainstorming ways that we can measure Social and Cultural Capital. We read articles and looked at websites to gain knowledge on potential measures. As we started our research, we wrote down measure ideas along the way. We discussed some of our ideas and talked about our concerns of the project so far. Our biggest concern was finding cultural measures.\n\n\nSocial Capitals:\n\nVolunteering rates\nParticipation in Civic Acts/Election turnout\nParticipation frequency in Clubs/ Communities\nCrime rates\nNumber of visits to the public library and the programs\nDontaions to local candidate committees and ballot issue committees\n\n\n\nCultural Captials:\n\nArt festival/ cultural events turnout\nMembership of cultural organizations\nNumber of distinct religions represented\nFrequency of atendance at religion services\n\n\n\nFindings\nWe found that it is much easier to think of social capitals compared to cultural capitals. The tricky part about Cultural Capitals is being able to find datasets for our measures. For example, a community could have a lot of cultural capital due to holding cultural events but there is very little or no data for us to look at.\nSome of the sources that we have found so far are:\n\nAmeriCorps\n\nInformation about volunteering and civic life\n\nSocial Capital Atlas\n\nInformation about econmic connectedness, cohesiveness, and civic engagement\n\nIowa Campaign Contributions Received\n\nInformation about political campaigns (committee, contribution amount, city)\n\nIowa Public Library Statistics\n\nInformation about the public libraries in Iowa counties"

The purpose of looking at employment shocks can help explain a communities well being. For example in the Tyson Food plants closure in Parry, Iowa will have a huge impact on it’s community. 1,276 people will be losing their job. As she started to look the datasets she found that there are three different notice types: Amendment, Mass Layoff, Closing, and Workforce reduction. She found that there were some miss spellings or slight character differences between the name of the companies and cities. Her next steps are to continue cleaning the data, fix the values so that they match up with each other, and start making visualizations.\n\n# Read in the data set\nWARN_2005_2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"Data/WARN_2005_2024.csv\")\nWARN_2005_2024$`WARN Received Date` &lt;- as.POSIXct(WARN_2005_2024$`WARN Received Date`, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nWARN_2005_2024$`Effective Date` &lt;- as.POSIXct(WARN_2005_2024$`Effective Date`, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Variables\nW05_24_V &lt;- WARN_2005_2024[ ,-c(8,9,10,13)]\n\n\n# Unique values\nsort(unique(WARN_2005_2024$`Company`))\nsort(unique(WARN_2005_2024$`City`))\nunique(WARN_2005_2024$`Notice Type`)\nsort(unique(WARN_2005_2024$`County`))\n\n\n\nHealth\nWe believe that there are some indirect correlations between health facilities and social capitals, especially the establishments and closures of health facilities in some specific areas leading to changes in capitals.\nThat’s why we collect and analyse data sources regarding nursing homes. We have 3 datasets:\n\nNursing Homes from CMS, consisting of 100 columns and 14,860 observations\nIowa Medicaid Payments with 9 columns and 98,305 observations representing the Medicaid reports\nNursing Facility Closures includes data for facilities that closed in 2023\n\nand 9 datasets for nursing homes from 2015 to 2022, which will be used to identify the facility closures.\nIllustrations:\n\ncms_nursinghome_df = read.csv(\"Data/Health/CMS_Nursing_Homes.csv\")\ncolnames(cms_nursinghome_df) &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\.\", \" \", colnames(cms_nursinghome_df))\nhead(cms_nursinghome_df)\n\n\n\n\n\nmedicaid_df = read.csv(\"Data/Health/Iowa_Medicaid_Payments.csv\")\ncolnames(medicaid_df) &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\.\", \" \", colnames(medicaid_df))\ncolnames(medicaid_df)[colnames(medicaid_df) == \"Vendor Name\"] &lt;- \"Provider Name\"\ncolnames(medicaid_df)[colnames(medicaid_df) == \"Vendor Number\"] &lt;- \"Provider Number\"\nhead(medicaid_df)\n\n\n\n\n\nclosure_df = readxl::read_excel(\"Data/Health/Nursing_Facility_Closures.xlsx\")\nhead(closure_df)\n\n\n\n\nFirst approach: We want to identify the opening and closing dates for each provider, so our first approach is to utilize the “Report Date” column in the medicaid dataset. Whenever a payment is made to a provider, a report will be recorded. So we first used the most recent report date and the oldest report date as estimates for the opening and closing dates, but…\n\nmedicaid_df_latest_filtered &lt;- medicaid_df %&gt;%\n                          group_by(`Provider Name`) %&gt;%\n                          summarise(estimate_closing = max(`Report Date`))\nmedicaid_df_oldest_filtered &lt;- medicaid_df %&gt;%\n                          group_by(`Provider Name`) %&gt;%\n                          summarise(estimate_opening = min(`Report Date`))\nopening_closing_medicaid &lt;- medicaid_df_latest_filtered %&gt;%\n                              full_join(medicaid_df_oldest_filtered, by = \"Provider Name\") %&gt;%\n                              select(`Provider Name`, `estimate_opening`, `estimate_closing`)\nopening_closing_medicaid\n\n\n\n\nSecond approach: We collect 9 additional datasets regarding active providers from 2015 to 2022, and compare the consecutive years to estimate the year a provider closes. Illustrations are below:\n\n\n\nSo by looking at this planned dataframe, we can estimate the provider with ID 1506000 closed in 2018 and use that insight to identify the effect of the closure on the community."

Creating a graph where housing density is on the x-axis, housing prices are on the y-axis, and each city is a different color would result in a graph that conveys the relationship. We would likely need to only look at the cities that have more than 2 residential districts, as those district types likely wouldn’t provide a clear relationship, given the limited data they would provide.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is zoning’s effect on transportation times/costs?\n\n\nDoes commute time affect purchase rate and/or price? If so, how?\n\n\nHow does the cost of living in the suburbs with decreased land prices compare to the cost of commuting to work?\n\n\nHow does the number of unsold homes relate to the zoning area?
