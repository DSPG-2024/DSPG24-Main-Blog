The syntax is very similar, but requires an ! in the front. So an example would be ![Stock Photo of a Data Cat](imgs/Data_Cat.png)\n\n\n\nStock Photo of a Data Cat\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image in the yaml, the first image in the post will be used as the thumbnail of the post. A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

When you’ve created a code chunk, you will want to switch the section that is typically in the form of {r} to {python} or whatever other supported language you wish to use.\nHere is a Python code block.\n\nimport platform\n\nprint(\"This code is run using python version\", platform.python_version())\n\nThis code is run using python version 3.9.18"

After graduation, I plan to pursue a career as a data scientist in the business and finance field. I am drawn to the intricate patterns and strategic decisions that data can unveil in financial markets and business operations. The ability to analyze complex datasets, uncover trends, and make data-driven decisions excites and motivates me. Also, I hope to be able to help the customers to make better financial decisions, identify frauds, reduce risks based on data-driven insights."

I am familiar with Pandas and Matplotlib using Python to perform data preprocessing, cleaning, analysis and visualization. Working with data in a team setting for the first time was an eye-opening experience as I get to collaborate with students from various background and getting insights and learning from one another. To make full use of my summer, I plan to enroll in several online courses for R and AI to buck up my skills.\n\n\n\nThree skills that I would like to learn from the DSPG program\n\nI would love to gain a deeper understanding on AI and its application on a real-world datasets. I would like to use this program as a stepping stone to allow me to apply AI under the guidance of mentors. Besides AI, I would like to use this opportunity to further enhance my programming skills specifically in Python and R. Lastly, beyond the technical skills, I hope to improve my ability to communicate and explain complex technical data findings to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n\n\nWhy the three skills\n\n\nApplying AI to real-world datasets allows me to understand practical challenges and develop solutions that are impactful and relevant to industry needs more efficiently\nHaving strong programming skills enable me to implement data analysis and visualization effectively as Python and R are one of the primary languages used in data science\nWhile dealing with sophiscated AI models and analyses, having the ability to communicate my findings clearly to stakeholders ensure that my work can be fully utilized and impactful towards the intended audiences\n\n\n\n\nSteps that I would take to improve my skills\n\n\nHave an open mind by experimenting with different data science tools and to seek mentorship from peers\nPratice working on real-world datasets to gain practical experience (participate in DSPG, hackathons)\nPractice presenting my findings through reports, presentations, and visualizations as well as constant engage activity such as public speaking"

I enjoy coming up with new ideas for solving problems. Not giving up on finding actually meaningful results that can have a postive impact.\n\n\n\nthree skills you want to develop\n\n\n\nPython and R are extremely important skills for data science and I have been working with the long enough to know how valuable they can be. I also really like using Tableau, I think it’s popular for a reason, for being as high level as it is it can do some pretty complex things such as being able to use SQL to manipulate data while in tableau.\n\n\n\nwhy these skills?\n\n\n\nI’m pursuing these skills because I believe they are the best tools for data sciences to become successful. It’s a safer bet to say that in Python and R will still be relevant in 10 years but some of the higher level skills may be replaces by ai or somethings even higher level.\n\n\n\nhow are you going to improve skills?\n\n\n\nWork on them everyday. The more I work with these technologies the more comfortable I will get with them overtime and the faster I can get things done with them."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello, My name is Cael Leistikow\n\nWhere are you from?\nI grew up in Frederika, Iowa which is about 30 minutes north of Waterloo and I attended New Hampton High School.\n\n\nWhat’s your current academic year?\nI am currently a Senior at Iowa State going into my fourth year with intentions of graduating next Spring.\n\n\nWhat degrees are you studying?\nI am majoring in Data science with a minor in Economics\n\n\nWhy did you choose your degrees?\nI chose these degree because I had always been fascinated by statistics, especially sports statistics, and as I went through high school I began to grow an interest in programming as well and when I discovered that Iowa State offered a degree that was a mixture of the two, I knew that it was what I wanted to pursue.\n\n\nWhat are your plans with your degree(s)?\nMy plans for after college is to use my degrees as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist within the business sector and having my Economics degree as well to be able to apply my knowledge towards making informative business decisions. After a few years I would consider to go for my dream job of working as a sports data analyst for a professional US sports team, preferably in baseball or football.\n\n\nWhy do you care about data science?\nI care about data science cause I firmly believe that it is the future towards optimizing and maximizing everything that we do in society. Everything that we do can be put into data and being able to understand how to work with and interpret that data is very valuable. Although it comes with a lot of power that can be manipulated if the owner so desires.\n\n\n\nDo you have any prior experience with data science?\nI have taken numerous data science courses here at Iowa State. I have had an internship with Kingland Systems as a Data Research Analyst. Finally, I have been a Statistician when I was playing under levels of athletics for the varsity team in high school.\n\n\nWhat kinds of extracurricular activities/hobbies do you care about?\nMy extracurricular activities are the Sports Analytics Club, Data Science Club, and Intramural sports.\nMy favorite hobbies are playing basketball, watching sports and going to games, hanging out with friends, listening to music, cooking, and travel.\n\n\nWhat do you want your peers to know about you?\n\nAn interesting fact about me is I have visited 24 of the 50 states as well as DC and Canada. Obviously I like to travel. My favorite trip being to Colorado. Additionally, my most desired place to travel next would be Hawaii as I haven’t gone outside on the intercontinental US or Canada.\n\n\nList some skills in data science that you feel you do well?\nI feel I do very well in data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning/modeling, R programming as it is my more preferred programming language, and finally SQL and database management.\n\n\nList at least three skills you would like to learn or develop during the DSPG program.\nI would like to develop during the DSPG program is AI development as AI is going to continue to integrated itself in everyday life. Another skill I would like to learn is GIS as I have seen a lot of employers looking for candidates who are able to effectively use GIS. Finally, the last thing I would like to learn is how the data science process works in a real-world scenario that I could then apply in the future.\n\n\nWhy are you pursuing these skills? Why do they matter to you?\nThe reason I’m pursuing these skills and why the matter to me is because I want to be able to put myself in the best position I can for when I’m beginning to look for my full-time career. Being a senior this coming year I need to refine and learn any skills that I can to help me stand out as a candidate to make sure I position myself for the job I want and to have a successful life.\n\n\nHow do you hope to improve these skills?\nI hope to learn and improve these skills through Datacamp as a tutorial for GIS or AI to help create a foundational understanding and then from there apply it to the projects to help use this knowledge on a real-world issue. Additionally, learning from the project leaders and the lunch talks during the program will help me see from other people’s perspective and ask questions to grow my understanding further."

This is how I stumbled across the DSPG program and applied to be a graduate fellow for summer of 2022. I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."

    "text": "The basics\n\n\n\nI am originally from Tennessee, but moved to Iowa so I could attend Iowa State.\n\n\n\nI will enter my 3rd year at Iowa State this fall.\n\n\n\nI am currently majoring in data science and linguistics. I enjoy studying data science because I like learning about how I can take data and apply code in order to learn new things about how the world works. I am studying linguistics because I enjoy it, and hope someday to work on NLP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy goals\n\n\n\nAs I stated above, I would love to work on NLP. In addition, I hope to use my degrees to help people, so that the world becomes a better place because I was in it.\n\n\n\nI care about data science because it’s fun. It might be selfish of me, but I don’t think I would care half as much if I didn’t enjoy the puzzle of figuring out what code and formulas need to be inputted in order to find a solution.\n\n\n\nI don’t have much experience working solely in data science, but I am currently in a computational linguistics lab. I have also worked in a computational biochemical lab with a focus on using AI for predictive modeling of protein synthesis. In both of those labs, I routinely used Excel or Python to work with large data sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\n\n\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading, crochet, and foraging. It’s legal to forage wild plants on public land in Iowa, and there’s a lot of really interesting food not sold in stores. I find that searching for new plants to try is a good exercise both mentally, in terms of improving my knowledge of plant identification, and physically because I get to go out and explore nature!\n\n\n\nI’m very interested in learning - anything and everything is fun to learn about. I’ve spent hours in Parks Library’s stacks, getting lost in books on the history of Iowa State’s water system (the water system originally had slightly higher calcium levels than ideal. That book is in the highest stack and has a coupon for 99 cent pizza and a drink. Unfortunately, the coupon expired in 1995) or, if you look at the mining data on the 3rd stack, you can learn that Quebec produced 450 thousand tons of Asbestos in 1941. It’s so cool how much there is to learn in the stacks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills, Future Goals, and Looking Forward\n\n\n\nI appreciate my ability to stay calm in a crisis. Additionally, I think I’m good at working consistently on longer projects.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, I think I’m decent at determining potential trends in data before I work very much with it. I run into a lot of errors when I code, but that means I’ve become pretty good at debugging, which certainly isn’t the worst skill to have.\n\n\n\nI hope to broaden the scope of my python experience, better understand the specific methodologies and fields in which data science can be applied to improve the world, and improve my understanding of different data science software adn how they work together to form a project.\n\n\n\nI have skills in python, but the data I’ve worked with and the things I’ve done in the language aren’t quite the same as what I expect I will use during the course of this program.\n\n\n\nI want to better understand the industry and what part I could play.\n\n\n\nI plan to take detailed documentation on every process I follow (not so detailed that it distracts from the work, but detailed enough that I’ll be able to retrace my steps and better remember what I did).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End\n\n\nThank you for looking at my presentation.\n\n\nTo learn more about me, feel free to find my LinkedIn.\n\n\nOr, some of my coding projects are hosted on my GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly complex, I believe it is important to have tools that can explain this complexity in such a way that people who have to make decisions are able to fully understand the topics they’re making decisions about. I want to be someone who knows how to weild those tools in order to make the world a better place."

I am from Ghana, West Africa, and I’m pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at Iowa State University (as of Spring 2024).\n\nResearch Interests\n\nCausal Inference\nInfectious Disease\nData Integration\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nPhD Applied Mathematics, Iowa State University (08/2023 - 05/2024)\nMSc Applied Stats. & Data Science, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) (08/2021 - 05/2023)\nBSc Mathematics, University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Ghana (09/2016 - 08/2020)\n\n\n\nExperience\n\nGraduate Fellow, Data Science for the Public Good, Iowa State (05/2024 - Present)\nGraduate Teaching Assistant, Department of Mathematics, Iowa State (08/2023 - 05/2023)\nSustainability Research Fellow, Office for Sustainability, UTRGV (08/2022 - 05/2023)\nGraduate Teaching Assistant, School of Math. & Stats.

As I embark on the DSPG program, I seek to improve my leadership and mentoring capabilities, alongside acquiring new technical expertise. An important goal for me is to refine my communication skills to effectively convey data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, I aim to master the management and extraction of value from extensive real-world datasets, leveraging these skills to make impactful decisions and contributions.\nIn my leisure time, I enjoy listening to music, watching soccer games and playing video games.\n\n\nWhy I Care about Data Science\nI remember the moment I became interested in advanced research in Data Science. It was during my master’s research, where I evaluated the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on chronic kidney disease (CKD). I used propensity score matching to address differences in patient characteristics that might influence SGLT2 prescription. Additionally, I utilized machine learning models to predict CKD cases. Since the dataset was imbalanced, I applied balanced bagging with bootstrapping and synthetic minority oversampling to balance the distribution of CKD and non-CKD cases in the training data. This aimed to facilitate improved learning on the training dataset and enhance predictions on the testing data. The analysis revealed that individuals taking SGLT2 had fewer CKD cases than those who did not, highlighting the protective effect of SGLT2 on CKD. This shows the potential of statistics and data science in extracting meaningful insights from healthcare data.\nHowever, amidst this revelation, a significant issue surfaced - the absence of reliable data for marginalized populations, resulting in disproportionately worse health outcomes. Since then, my focus evolved from merely using models to make predictions to understanding the “why” and “what-if” behind those predictions. I realized that relying solely on supervised models was insufficient for this purpose, prompting me to develop methods that could integrate machine learning and causal approaches to address and explain predictions in imbalanced datasets.\n\n\n\nFigure Reference (Causality for Machine Learning)\n\n\nAs a consequence, I aim to leverage machine learning with causal methods to understand the influence of policies and interventions on diseases outcomes across various data sources. I seek to move from prediction-based models to learning independent causal models in areas like transfer and meta-learning. This approach will aid in integrating diverse healthcare datasets, often compounded by heterogeneous patient characteristics and medical protocols, ensuring the generalizability of my findings against external datasets. Additionally, I aim to create models capable of scaling up datasets to better reflect the diversity of the population. My goal is to enhance model interpretability through counterfactual reasoning and mitigate algorithmic biases for fair and equitable outcomes, ensuring the reliability of healthcare research across different demographics."

    "text": "My identity\n\nCountry\nI, Tabassum Zaman, come from a Southasian country named “Bangladesh”. Which has got some amazing stories to tell people about itself to tell the world. But I will keep it short today to be focused on the objective of this blog.\n\n\n\n\nBangladesh with its surrounding countries\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of Dhaka city (capital of Bangladesh)\n\n\n\n\n\nAcamedics\nDepartment: Community and Regional Planning\nProgram: Masters\nInstitution: Iowa State University\nI completed my undergrad in ‘Urban and Regional Planning’ from my dream university in Bangladesh which was ‘BUET [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]’. I have been always interested in the Transportation problem surrounding me, may be because that’s all I saw. But with time as I am exploring more, I am finding my new interested areas in spatial problems like, housing, accessibility. I am hoping to be focused down in a very near future, as I finished up my semester of masters program this Spring 2024.\n\n\n\nMy Undergrad Convocation from BUET in Urban and Regional Planning\n\n\n\n\nWhat got me into Data Science\nAfter completing my undergrad I had the opportunity to work in the real world for more than a couple of years, in transportation, health care and commodity industry back home. There I got to know the power of data and story telling. You can influence decision through your stories but it has to be backed by data and presented in a comprehensible format and your one little presentation can really changes lives. I can go on giving a number of examples to show how it has motivated me, but I will stop here, and keep my Focus.\nSo, my encounter of Data Science is through excel (you can do a lot of stuff there too) and for spatial one if through GIS (Geographic Information System). I know some basics of SQL, R, Python, but not enough to score good in quiz. But I am betting on my time here and the aim is to have the most productive time this summer 2024 and see the result after 10 weeks. I will come back to share the updates!\n\n\nMy Leisure\nI do not really have any particular talents apart from the academics one, but apart from sleep and watching tv, I love a good conversation of getting to know new people, good food, some cooking, travelling, a little bit of gardening and reading fictions. Pretty ordinary things!"
