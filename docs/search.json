This was then expanded to cover more area, as now we can capture images and create masks for each building in the Des Moines area.\nShown below is an example of a census block satellite image along with it’s mask and then overlay-ed on top of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlap\n\n\n\n\n\nThese images and masks will be used to fine tune our semantic segmentation model that will be able to take a satellite image and segment out the buildings in the image from their pixel values. The classification of these pixels will be determined in our model and builds will be labeled as 1 and the surrounding environment as 0. This will allow us to given a better visualization of a city and building’s layout when prompted by the user to plot a map in the chat bot."

    "text": "Satellite Imagery\nThis week, we completed the fine tuning of our image segmentation model using the National Agricultural Imagery Program(NAIP) and Polk County Building Footprints datasets. With the completion of this model, we are now able to identify buildings out of a satellite image with the goal of applying it to more rural communities. Next, we wanted to talk about how the model works and was developed. Below is a flowchart to help visualize the process.\n\n\nImage Preprocessing\nTo start off, we loaded in shape files containing the polygon geometry of census blocks of Polk County as well as the building footprints in Polk County. Next, we take these geometries to specify our location in in Earth Engine and cut them out of the NAIP image to get out regular image and our masks. From here we take the regular image and convert it from RGBA to RGB imagery and resize it to 1920 x 1080 pixels. For the masks resizing still applies but these get converted to gray scale images with any part not in the building cut out set to a pixel color of 0 and the buildings set to a value 1. The reason we do this is to get our images in the same format as the pretrained backbone model’s images.\n\n\nDataset and Fine Tuning\nTo create our datasets, we take our preprocessed images and split them into a training dataset and a validation dataset making sure to keep our image masks in the same group as our true image. From here we assign our classification of our pixel values to be just the environment around a building or part of a building. This is why we specified our pixel values during preprocessing to 0 and 1 for masks. With this, we take our classifications and images and input them into the pretrained Segformer model so that we can fine tune it to be trained on our specific images and classifications. Once completed, we store our newly trained model.\n\n\nInference\nFinally, we can now test our model on an image to see how it performs. Shown below is an example output of a prototype version of the model trained on only 5 images.\n\n\n\nBiggest Takeaways\n\nThe model performs well at identifying groups of buildings and buildings in the open\nTrees and other blockers cause some disruption with the model\nTraining on larger set of images will be helpful which we have over 8000 to use\n\n\n\nUI Features\nThis We have also worked on Improvising the UI designing and add some new features to the UI.\n\nSearch Functionality:\n\nFilters chat list based on the search term entered by the user.\n\n\n\nChat List Display:\n\nShows a summary of each chat, including the first few words of the user’s message and a type indicator (Text, Image, Map).\n\n\n\nDynamic Filtering / Interaction Features:\n\nFilters chats in real-time as the user types in the search input.\n\n\n\nText and Map Generation:\n\nGenerates content with descriptive text followed by an embedded map iframe.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving Forward:\n\nwe will have feedback feature implemented and more UI enhancement!"

However, there is some disparity when commute time is lower, as rent is more disparate there.\n\n \n\n\nThis GIS map of rent over commute time further confirms that rent tends to decrease as commute time increases. Further research will be done to see how gas costs affect affordability of living further from an urban center.\n\n \n\nWhile the general trend for Iowa is that a greater commute correlates with lower rent, the opposite is true in Des Moines.

There are frequently less than 15 zoning districts for smaller cities, though we have not yet encountered a city with fewer than seven districts.\nThis is an example of what district code for a zone in a smaller town might look like.

I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello, My name is Cael Leistikow\n\nWhere are you from?\nI grew up in Frederika, Iowa which is about 30 minutes north of Waterloo and I attended New Hampton High School.\n\n\nWhat’s your current academic year?\nI am currently a Senior at Iowa State going into my fourth year with intentions of graduating next Spring.\n\n\nWhat degrees are you studying?\nI am majoring in Data science with a minor in Economics\n\n\nWhy did you choose your degrees?\nI chose these degree because I had always been fascinated by statistics, especially sports statistics, and as I went through high school I began to grow an interest in programming as well and when I discovered that Iowa State offered a degree that was a mixture of the two, I knew that it was what I wanted to pursue.\n\n\nWhat are your plans with your degree(s)?\nMy plans for after college is to use my degrees as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist within the business sector and having my Economics degree as well to be able to apply my knowledge towards making informative business decisions. After a few years I would consider to go for my dream job of working as a sports data analyst for a professional US sports team, preferably in baseball or football.\n\n\nWhy do you care about data science?\nI care about data science cause I firmly believe that it is the future towards optimizing and maximizing everything that we do in society. Everything that we do can be put into data and being able to understand how to work with and interpret that data is very valuable. Although it comes with a lot of power that can be manipulated if the owner so desires.\n\n\n\nDo you have any prior experience with data science?\nI have taken numerous data science courses here at Iowa State. I have had an internship with Kingland Systems as a Data Research Analyst. Finally, I have been a Statistician when I was playing under levels of athletics for the varsity team in high school.\n\n\nWhat kinds of extracurricular activities/hobbies do you care about?\nMy extracurricular activities are the Sports Analytics Club, Data Science Club, and Intramural sports.\nMy favorite hobbies are playing basketball, watching sports and going to games, hanging out with friends, listening to music, cooking, and travel.\n\n\nWhat do you want your peers to know about you?\n\nAn interesting fact about me is I have visited 24 of the 50 states as well as DC and Canada. Obviously I like to travel. My favorite trip being to Colorado. Additionally, my most desired place to travel next would be Hawaii as I haven’t gone outside on the intercontinental US or Canada.\n\n\nList some skills in data science that you feel you do well?\nI feel I do very well in data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning/modeling, R programming as it is my more preferred programming language, and finally SQL and database management.\n\n\nList at least three skills you would like to learn or develop during the DSPG program.\nI would like to develop during the DSPG program is AI development as AI is going to continue to integrated itself in everyday life. Another skill I would like to learn is GIS as I have seen a lot of employers looking for candidates who are able to effectively use GIS. Finally, the last thing I would like to learn is how the data science process works in a real-world scenario that I could then apply in the future.\n\n\nWhy are you pursuing these skills? Why do they matter to you?\nThe reason I’m pursuing these skills and why the matter to me is because I want to be able to put myself in the best position I can for when I’m beginning to look for my full-time career. Being a senior this coming year I need to refine and learn any skills that I can to help me stand out as a candidate to make sure I position myself for the job I want and to have a successful life.\n\n\nHow do you hope to improve these skills?\nI hope to learn and improve these skills through Datacamp as a tutorial for GIS or AI to help create a foundational understanding and then from there apply it to the projects to help use this knowledge on a real-world issue. Additionally, learning from the project leaders and the lunch talks during the program will help me see from other people’s perspective and ask questions to grow my understanding further."

We would then combine that data with the data we have on the average price per house in those zones. Creating a graph where housing density is on the x-axis, housing prices are on the y-axis, and each city is a different color would result in a graph that conveys the relationship. We would likely need to only look at the cities that have more than 2 residential districts, as those district types likely wouldn’t provide a clear relationship, given the limited data they would provide.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is zoning’s effect on transportation times/costs?\n\n\nDoes commute time affect purchase rate and/or price? If so, how?\n\n\nHow does the cost of living in the suburbs with decreased land prices compare to the cost of commuting to work?\n\n\nHow does the number of unsold homes relate to the zoning area?

    "text": "Understanding Community and Capitals\nBefore delving into the concept of community capitals, it’s essential to understand what constitutes a community and what we mean by capitals. A community can be understood through several aspects:\n\nGeographic-based: This includes neighborhoods, towns, cities, counties, etc.\nOrganization-based: Communities formed around workplaces, schools, and other organizations.\nIdentity-based: Communities linked to one’s hometown, vacation spots, and other personal affiliations.\n\nA healthy community encompasses all three components. It has distinct physical boundaries, serves as a primary location for employment and services, and fosters a strong attachment to the place.\nSo, what is a capital? Capital refers to assets that are ‘invested’ to generate new resources. Key characteristics of capitals include:\n\nThey can be overused and depleted.\nThey must be utilized to grow; otherwise, they depreciate.\nThey are embodied in individuals and organizations.\nThey function as public goods.\nGenerally, having more capital is beneficial, but not always."

However, for our project we focused on Built, Natural, Social, and Cultural capitals. These capitals are more challenging to measure and find data sources for. In contrast, Financial Capital can be easily quantified using metrics like median household income, the number of businesses, etc. On the other hand, measuring cultural, built, social, and natural capitals are much more complex and less straightforward."

    "text": "Technologies\n\nProgramming Languages\nPython and R are well-known for their robust capabilities in data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing. Both languages offer extensive libraries and frameworks that facilitate efficient data acquisition, manipulation, and presentation, making them ideal for comprehensive data-driven projects.\n\n\nPackages\n\n\n\nThe packages we used can be categorized into three key areas: Data Visualization, Data Acquisition, and Data Preprocessing. Each category encompasses specific libraries and tools essential for our project.\n\nData Visualization\n\nLeaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. In our project, Leaflet is used to create interactive spatial visualization to understand how capitals are distributed across Iowa. For example: distribution of museums, monuments, etc.\nMatplotlib: A comprehensive Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is highly customizable and works well with data in various formats.\nSeaborn: A Python visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Both Matplotlib and Seaborn were primarily utilized for visualizing categorical and numerical data, rather than maps or interactive graphs. These libraries were particularly useful for generating quick and straightforward insights. For instance, they allowed us to easily visualize the proportion of obsolete or deficient bridges compared to the total number of bridges within a county.\n\nData Acquisition\n\nTidycensus: Designed to help R users get Census data that is pre-prepared for exploration within the tidyverse, and optionally spatially with sf. It was often used to fetch American Community Survey data such as number of single-parent households.\nTigris: An R package that allows users to directly download and use TIGER/Line shapefiles. It was used to fetch spatial locations of different Iowa cities and counties for visualization.\nsf: An R package supports for simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector data. It is used to extract the intersection of two areas (e.g: a long stream across multiple county) and calculate spatial parameters, including lengths and areas, etc.\n\nData Preprocessing\n\nTidyverse: An R package for data manipulation and analysis. It was widely used across the Community Capital project to handle and transform data into the expected format.\nPandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, offering data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It excels at transforming raw datasets into structured and usable formats, making it indispensable for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.\nScikit-learn: A Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised problems. In our project, it was primarily used for feature scaling to ensure consistent feature values, enhancing the accuracy of visualizations and analyses. Scaling was crucial as we dealt with multiple datasets and features that had varying numerical ranges."

    "text": "Data Processing\nThe images and datasets shown below are only for illustrations of different data processing steps in our project.\n\nLack of Reliable Data\nChallenge: For ACS city-level data, most cities had very few population, resulting in high margin of errors in a lot of measures.\nResolution: To this point, the only good resolution for the lack of data was to use county-level data which significantly cutting down the margin of errors. For city-level data, we created an indicator for high/low margin of errors.\n\n\nData Transformation\nOur data for different measures came in different ranges and format. We needed to transform our data into a meaningful format that could be easily used in different processes of the project as well as scale and normalize the data to decrease the effect of population differences.\nWe are clearly aware that there are differences in population sizes among cities and counties. Therefore, in order to normalize our data, we took the proportion with respect to the population sizes, formulated meaningful index and calculated the respective measure.\n\n\n\n\nNormalization\n\n\n\nThe preprocessed datasets shown below has more than 15,000 rows and 80 columns in each. After processing missing data, handling mistyped value, transforming the data into correct format and merging tables together, we achieved a single formatted dataset.\n\n\n\n\nActive Nursing Homes from 2015 to 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Processed Data\n\n\n\nFor spatial data, we needed to utilize R packages such as tigris and sf to gauge and extract the areas, lengths and locations of different objects in Iowa. The images below showed the stream lengths after processed. We also did some processing to extract the intersection of the streams among counties to see where they are lying.\nFun fact: A lot of streams have different parts and their parts lying in different counties.\n\n\n\n\nStream Length\n\n\n\n\n\nStreams Locations\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Index Formulation\nFor some measures such as race and religious diversity, we formulated a Simpson Index to gauge the “diversity” of communities.\nInterpretation: The chance of picking two random individuals that have different race or beliefs.\nFormula:\n\n\n\n\nSimpson Index Formula\n\n\n\nExplanation: \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is the number of pairs in the same group and \\(\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}\\) is the number of pairs among all individuals, so we take the sum of the number of pairs within groups divided by the total number of pairs.\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Example\n\n\n\n\\[D = 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sum n(n-1)}{N(N-1)} \\right) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{130}{20(20-1)} \\right) = 0.3421\\] Meaningfully, there is a chance of 0.3421 to randomly select two individuals of different origins."

    "text": "Challenges\nWith such a lot of data sources and measures, our challenges mostly lie in the data preprocessing.\n1. Learning New Technologies: We needed to become proficient in new languages such as R and its associated packages, particularly for handling datasets and creating helpful visualizations. Our initial weeks of training on DataCamp significantly helped us get up to speed and positioned us better for the project’s demands.\n\n\n\n\nR Training\n\n\n\n2. Data Collection: Gathering measures for Built, Natural, Cultural, and Social capitals was already challenging but finding reliable data sources for them was even more difficult. We faced additional hurdles such as web scraping, dealing with datasets in various formats like geojson, and making API calls.\n\n\n\n3. Feature Engineering: In data science, feature engineering involves transforming or creating new features from existing columns. This process demands a deep understanding of the dataset and precise calculations. For instance, in our events database project, we needed to create columns for Simpson index for diversity or ‘event_magnitude’, which is used to summarize the impact of specific events. This task sometimes required standardization, formula creation, and intuitive weighting."

    "title": "Community Capitals Final Presentation",
    "section": "Tableau Dashboard",
    "text": "Tableau Dashboard\n\nEvent Database\nThe Event Database Dashboard has three main components: a map to visualize the count of events within each county from 1946 to 2024, a time series line plot to track event counts over the years, and a table detailing the specific events and their information. Users can filter the data by event type (e.g., natural disasters, employment layoffs), adjust a year slider ranging from 1946 to 2024, and select a specific county.\n\nDashboard Filters\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Closures(Nursing homes, Schools, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot & Map for Facility Closures\n\n\n\n\n\nACS Time Series Analysis\nWe have developed a dashboard specifically for visualizing measures from the American Community Survey (ACS) data, one of the primary sources for our Community Capitals project. The ACS dashboard allows for easy access to data across different time periods (2012-2022), providing a consistent and convenient way to analyze trends over time. This dashboard aims to facilitate comprehensive insights into community changes, supporting informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\nDashboard Filters\n\n\n\n\nACS Dashboard Filters\n\n\n\n\n\nACS Line Plot\nThe purpose of using a line plot is to observe how ACS measure values have fluctuated over the years and to compare trends across multiple cities over time. Unlike a bar chart, a line plot can effectively display data from 20-30 counties while maintaining visual appeal. This makes it an excellent tool for identifying patterns and drawing meaningful insights from complex datasets.\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot comparing multiple places\n\n\n\nThe graph below displays the trend line for measure ‘Proportion of Employment in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and Mining Industry’ across various cities. The data reveals fluctuations in employment proportions over time. Notably, Ames and Ankeny exhibit a decline, whereas Iowa City and Urbandale show an increase over the past decade. However, it’s important to note that the margin of error for Iowa City in 2017 and 2022 is high, which suggests that the observed increase in these years might not be entirely accurate.\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot for few places\n\n\n\n\n\nACS Bar Chart\nThe bar chart is crucial for comparing values across a few counties, as illustrated in the graph below. By displaying data for three cities—Ames, Ankeny, and Des Moines—across three years (2012, 2017, 2022) for the measure ‘Proportion of Single-Parent Households’, it effectively highlights trends and differences over time. This visualization allows users to easily identify patterns and make informed decisions based on the data. Furthermore, the ability to customize the chart by filtering specific years and adding more cities enhances its flexibility and utility, enabling a more tailored analysis.\n\n\n\n\nACS Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting Findings with ACS and Events\nYou don’t have to treat each dashboard as individuals; you may explore different dashboards and their measures to identify patterns or interesting findings. For example, by examining the Proportion of Long-distance Commute to Work measure from our ACS dashboard, we observed a significant decrease in commute times for ‘Ankeny’ post-2017. Without local job creation or economic development, such a decrease in commute time would be unusual. However, upon reviewing the economic development projects in our Events database, we found several projects initiated in Ankeny after 2017, which likely contributed to the reduced commute times. Local economic development has played a significant role; Ankeny has experienced substantial investments in new commercial and residential projects. For example, in 2022, the city permitted over $528 million in new construction, which includes both commercial and residential developments. This level of investment has been consistent over the past few years, indicating a sustained effort to improve local infrastructure and create jobs within the city itself. These developments likely provided more employment opportunities locally, reducing the need for residents to commute to Des Moines or Ames (Ankeny Economic Development). Additionally, the growing popularity of remote work in recent years must also be considered as a potential factor.\n\n\n\n\nACS Bar Chart & Events Database Table\n\n\n\n\n\nExplorations & Maps\n\n Capital Measures Dashboard Filters\n\n\n Simpson Index Race Diversity\n\nThis map is of the Simpson Index Race Diversity. The circle size represents that population size of each city. The cities with the highest measure values are dark blue. Storm Lake, Conesville, Columbus Junction, and Denison have the highest measure values. We believe this is because these cities have big distribution plants. The plants offer an employment opportunity for a diverse workforce.\n\n Heat Wave Expected Annual Loss\n\nThis map shows the expected annual loss in dollars due to heat waves. Certain areas could have higher expected annual loss when there are large urban areas which have more intense heatwaves due to the urban heat island effect. If a certain county has a vulnerable population, for example the elderly, young children, or people with health conditions it can lead to people paying expensive medical bills and a higher need for healthcare services. That can increase the expected annual loss in a community.\n\n\nBivariate Analysis\nWe have developed a dashboard specifically for visualizing measures from the American Community Survey (ACS) data, one of the primary sources for our Community Capitals project. The ACS dashboard allows for easy access to data across different time periods (2012-2022), providing a consistent and convenient way to analyze trends over time. This dashboard aims to facilitate comprehensive insights into community changes, supporting informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\n Analysis Dashboard Filters\n\n\n Models of Simpson Index Race Diversity and Proportion of Proficient English Speakers\n\nThese bivariate plots show that there is a relationship between the Simpson Index race diversity and the proportion of proficient English speakers. The more diverse a community is the smaller the proportion of proficient English speakers.\n\n Correlation Dashboard Filters\n\n\n Correlation Between Economic Connectedness and Simpson Index Race Diversity\n\nThere is a high negative correlation between economic connectedness and race diversity. We believe this is due to cultural and language barriers. When a community has a higher diversity, it can create a cultural barrier when making friends. This could also be due to homophily social networks, which is when people connect with others that are similar to them which reduces economic connectedness. When there is a high economic connectedness, it can lead to a community having higher living costs. The people and families who have racially diverse backgrounds might have lower incomes which might lead them to move somewhere else. This can cause a lower Simpson Index for race diversity in a community.\n\n Correlation Between Economic Connectedness and Number of Voters\n\nThere is a high correlation between economic connectedness and the number of voters. We believe this could be because economically-connected people may have better education which leads to a greater understanding of politics. Economic connected areas also have a greater access to information, which leads to a greater awareness when it comes to elections, and issues. This leads to people being more informed and engaged when it comes to voting. When there are more people voting in a community there might be more civic organizations and political parties. That can increase the economic connectedness of a community."

    "text": "Iowa Homeownership Rate\nIowans primarily reside in two housing arrangements: owning a home or renting a home. A small percentage of the population falls outside these categories. We know most people would rather own a home, so a lower homeownership rate could be an indicator that less people are able to afford a home and settling for renting.\n\nCurrently, homeownership stands at 72%, a figure that, while higher than the national average of 65%, has been on a steady decline since the dot-com bubble in 2001. This trend places Iowa’s homeownership rate at a level comparable to its 1984 standing.\n\nThe median home value in Iowa hovers around $220,000, with a corresponding monthly mortgage payment of approximately $1,500. For renters, the median monthly gross rent is about $1,000. Although this may not seem high on a national level for Iowans the cost of owning and renting a home has increased significantly from just a couple years ago.\n\nHomeownership Insight\nBetween 2000 and 2018, homeownership declined, likely due to the relative affordability of renting compared to home buying. However, a shift occurred around 2018, with homeownership rates beginning to climb. This change is potentially linked to a reversal in affordability trends, as renting became increasingly expensive relative to homeownership."

In fact, it’s estimated that one-third of U.S. inflation is directly linked to changes in home prices. This suggests that the growth in Iowa home values has outpaced the broader inflationary trend\nThe median rent in Iowa currently sits at $1,175, reflecting a significant 6.8% increase compared to the previous year (Rent.com, 2024). Iowa ranks eighth in the nation for the largest increase in median gross rent in the last year (Rent.com, 2024).\n\nHousing Vs.

This is more evidence that housing is becoming less affordable for Iowans. Home value increased more income from 2019-2022. Low interest rates certainly are a good explanation for this. Demand changes due to population changes may be another good reason for this, both of which we will touch on in later sections.\nThe rental market presents a contrasting narrative to homeownership. While housing prices surged during the pandemic, rental costs remained relatively stable. However, recent data indicates a shift in this trend. Rents in Iowa have experienced rapid growth in 2023 and 2024, coinciding with the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. This accelerated rental cost increase warrants further investigation to understand its implications for Iowa residents.\n\nIncome Insight\nThe cost to buy a home has far exceeded incomes while incomes have kept up with the cost of renting."

    "text": "Consider Interest Rates\nGenerally, the housing market slows down when interest rates are higher or increasing. When interest rates rise, the cost of owning a home becomes more expensive due to the higher interest payments, which reduces demand. This reduction in demand then results in a drop in home prices. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, housing demand increases, causing prices to rise.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2022, mortgage interest rates were on a downward trend, making homeownership more affordable and stimulating the housing market. However, starting in 2022, there was a sharp spike in interest rates for 30-year mortgage loans, jumping from around 3% to 7%. This could help explain why rent costs were still pretty affordable through 2022, and would explain why they would of increased once it become to expensive to own a home from increased interest rates.\nYou might wonder why, despite this increase in interest rates, home values continued to rise during the same period. This scenario is especially concerning for Iowa’s first-time homebuyers. They faced the double burden of elevated home prices and higher interest rates compared to just two years prior, in 2024. This situation makes entering the housing market significantly more challenging and expensive, potentially delaying or even preventing many from achieving homeownership."

    "section": "Reason one",
    "text": "Reason one\n\nConstruction hasn’t kept up with the number of people who need a home.\nRising costs to build a home is often the most common reason people give for rising house prices. Basic supply and demand tell us that if more people are looking to buy homes and fewer people are looking to sell, then prices will rise. A potential way to get an idea of housing supply is to examine the number of housing units, but it is a little bit more complicated to get housing demand, but I’m going to analyze change in population. We know that if population is increase we can expect more demand for houses. So viewing the change in housing units compared to the change in population is a logical place to start. However it’s important to note that more housing then people per household size may be built, but this doesn’t mean that construction is keeping up with demand.\n\nChange in household size is calculated by dividing the population change by 2.4 which is the average household size in Iowa.\nWhen we look at how many houses are being built compared to the changing population in Iowa, we see rising housing construction but slowing population growth; you would intuitively think housing prices would decrease because the housing supply would increase faster than demand. However, this graph isn’t saying that. All this graph proves is that new house construction per population level is going down, but this doesn’t mean there isn’t enough housing.\n\nWhen looking at the cities of Iowa, we see a direct correlation between the change in housing supply and the change in population, and we can see that there does appear to be more cities with a slighter greater change in housing supply than population. So this begs the question why could this be happening? Isn’t this evidence that there isn’t a housing shortage in Iowa?\nThe population may not be outgrowing the new housing supply but there are still a few problems that could be contributing to a housing shortage. I have identified 3 potential problems that occur when you just analyze the change in housing vs. the change in population:\n\nHouse deteriorating problem.\n\nWe don’t know how long houses have lasted in this period.  If homes are lasting longer or aren’t that old then we shouldn’t need to build as many home new homes for the growing population. In our case the opposite appears to be true the median year all the houses in Iowa were built in is 1965, with 26.9% being built before 1940(ISU indicators). For many homes there expected life span is going to be around 60 years meaning that many of Iowa’s homes would be ready for replacement and that should be causing greater construction of new homes regardless of population growth. It does seem that home deterioration may be a factor into why change in housing is exceeding change in population in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\nHousehold size changes problem.\n\nMore homes are actually needed to accommodate for roughly the same amount of people but who want to live with less people. This will result in a greater need for housing regardless of population growth. But this is more of a historical reason for why house prices have risen in the past in Iowa, because household size has actually become quite steady around 2.4 people per household in Iowa with even an increase in household size after the housing crisis of 2008, which household sizes have stayed elevated ever since. We can see that in the last decade household size has been relatively stable.\n\n\nIt doesn’t appear that in the last decade household size changes can be attributed to why change in housing development has exceeded change in population in Iowa.\n\n\nVacancies are increasing in certain areas problem.\n\nGiven that people are moving from rural Iowa to more urban areas, it may appear that housing supply is sufficient but actually the houses are in the wrong place and therefore being left vacant. This would result in an oversupply of housing in rural areas and an undersupply of housing in urban areas. We can see that house prices are increasing significantly more in urban areas which helps provide some evidence to this occurring. When we look at state-wide vacancy rates, we see they have been trending downward, but before the pandemic was very stable overall.  When analyzing the data we see that migration from rural to urban areas in Iowa has actually been slowing down and we don’t have strong evidence to the claim that people in rural areas are leaving more homes vacant driving up urban housing costs.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion to Construction Reason\nSo I looked deeper into housing production relative to population changing. We saw that enough housing is being built for the growing population, but we still can’t rule out that we aren’t experiencing a housing shortage because many houses in Iowa may be expiring and in need of reconstruction. However we can rule out that this is occurring due to housing vacancies or changes in household size."

    "text": "Reason Two\n\nThe Housing Dilemma\nThe development of affordable housing often presents a classic “tragedy of the commons” scenario. While constructing more apartments can alleviate housing shortages and potentially lower overall costs, it frequently faces opposition from existing homeowners. This resistance stems from concerns about property values, increased traffic, and potential changes to neighborhood character.\nWhen the individual interests of homeowners trumps the broader community interest in affordable housing this can contributing to rising house costs.\n\n\n\nWe can see that Iowa’s more populated urban area’s are more willing to allow for multi-family in order to lower housing costs than Iowa’s suburban and rural area’s. Because Iowa is significantly more rural and suburban than urban, we should expect Iowa to be more effected by increases in single-family houses then by multi-family housing."

    "section": "Reason Three",
    "text": "Reason Three\n\nExcessive Speculation\nIf houses were purely consumption goods like cars, food, etc., then explaining house prices purely based on supply and demand would be sufficient because the only economic factors affecting house prices would be the number of people who want a house and the number of houses available, unfortunately sometimes people treat housing as an investment and buy up houses expecting the prices to rise, when many people start doing this is drive up housing prices and causes a housing bubble.\n\nOne quick way to get an idea about whether we are experiencing a housing bubble is to look at housing vacancies. We should assume that vacancies should be decreasing as housing costs go up. But This doesn’t always happen though during the 2009 bubble massive house speculation increased housing prices despite the fact that more properties were left empty, vacancy rates in the U.S. peaked at 11.1% in 2009 and has been trending down since.\nIf you recall from my previous vacancy rate graph housing vacancies are trending down since 2006 in Iowa but have been on the rise since 2016 but it’s way below any alarming levels at this point."

So we looked at four reasons why housing prices may be rising:\n\nConstruction is not keeping up with demand for homes.\nThe housing Dilemma.\nInvestors are speculating on the market.\nPeople are taking on greater debt to get homes.\n\nAfter looking at these reasons we found that construction may be keeping up with demand and can’t be blamed for the housing shortage, we may be under producing multi-family housing in Iowa, which makes Iowa effected more by rises in single-family housing cost changes, there isn’t great evidence that we are experiencing a housing bubble even though vacancies have been rising since 2016 in Iowa, and Iowans didn’t take on to much debt to buy there homes."

    "title": "Iowa Zoning Guide Final Presentation",
    "section": "Comparing Classifications of Cities",
    "text": "Comparing Classifications of Cities\nWe have classified the cities into five groups, core cities of a Metropolitan Statistical Area, also known as MSA, (eg. Des Moines), metropolitan cities with above-average growth for their MSA (eg. Ankeny), metropolitan cities with below-average growth for their MSA (eg. Nevada), micropolitan cities (eg. Marshalltown), and rural places (eg. Decorah). Note that rural does not necessarily mean agricultural. A rural place is any place that did not meet the requirements for any of the other categories. It is any town with less than 10,000 people that is located outside of a metropolitan county. Ultimately, our goal is to understand the economic impacts of zoning on the housing market for different types of cities. Before this, we must first understand their housing markets. In the coming section, we seek to understand how much the median resident earns, how much they spend on housing, what percentage of residents in each city classification are cost-burdened by housing, and what income a resident would need to make to be below the cost-burden line for rent.\n\nMedian Income by City Classification\nThe median income is an important metric to consider when understanding the housing market. It can be used as a representation of the purchasing power of the residents of a city. The annual costs of homes and rentals means little without knowing how much one earns in a year. As seen below, metropolitan cities with above average growth consistently have the highest median incomes. The median of their median incomes is $7,216 per year higher than the second highest city classification, metropolitan cities with below average growth. Rural places account for a significant amount of the lowest median incomes. However, they have a large variance, and some rank among the highest median incomes. For core cities, 63% are below the 50th percentile with only one city, Bettendorf, ranking considerably higher. Although metropolitan cities with below average growth and micropolitan cities have interesting stories to tell of their own, they will not be included in this presentation to save time.\nClick to expand the photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Home Value by City Classification\nThe values of homes are necessary for understanding housing affordability. The median home values of metropolitan cities with above-average growth again tend to be the highest of any classification, particularly in Shueyville with a median income of $433,000. This is over $100,000 higher than the second highest city. The high median home value could be result of a small sample size. The population of Shueyville is 731 as of 2020. However, the margin of error for Shueyville is relatively low. The median home value follows a similar pattern as median income for rural places. The rural places make up a large part of the lower home values, yet they still reach some of the highest spots on the list. For example, Kent Estates has the sixth median home value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Gross Rent by City Classification\nGross rent is the amount of money a renter pays on their lease each month before subtracting additional costs, such as utilities. The vast majority of Iowans are homeowners, but renting is still common. The same pattern appears that was seen for median income and median home value. The metropolitan cities with above-average growth account for many of the highest median rents, whereas rural places account for many of the lowest median rents. The core cities form a tight cluster (or potentially 2 clusters) of high rents. Why are the values for the core cities’ median rents so close?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRent as a Percentage of Income by City Classification\nFor rent as a percentage of income, we divided annual median gross rent by annual median income, multiplied by 100. The dashed line at a constant 30% is the Cost-Burden Line. If a resident spends more than 30% of their income on housing, then they are considered cost-burdened. The cities that are above the cost-burden line have a rent/income percentage that is above 30%. The patterns within the distribution of the city types are nearly indiscernible, aside from the placements of the core cities. The core cities are consistently high, meaning their rent prices are higher in proportion to their income. The two core cities that are nearly the highest in the state are Ames and Iowa City. Both are college cities with many low-income students renting, increasing costs of rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost Burden\nThe below graph shows the percent of owners and renters who are cost-burdened by their housing or rent costs. As stated previously, the standard rule of thumb for cost-burden from housing is 30% of income. The residents represented on the below graph are spending more than 30% on housing or rent.\n\n\n\nRequired Income with Median Income\nWe have defined the required income as the income that a resident would need to afford the median gross rent with 30% of their income. For example, if their rent costs $30,000 per year, a resident would need $100,000 for the rent to equal 30% of their income. Required income does not mean a resident needs this amount of money to live in a certain city, nor is it a judgment stating that they should earn this much money. It is simply a measurement to determine rent affordability. For the below figure, the black bars represent the true median income for residents of the city classifications. The colored bars are the required income of the city classifications. If the colored bar is greater than the black bar, then the required income is greater than the median income for that city classification. Housing is less affordable. If the black bar is greater than the colored bar, then the median income is greater than the required income. Housing is more affordable.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nAfter researching zoning laws, we have found that cities of similar sizes tend to write their codes in similar ways. For example, large cities tend to encourage high-density development, whereas smaller cities tend to require larger setbacks and lot sizes, lowering density. We are working to determine the economic impacts of these zoning decisions, particularly their impact on the housing market. We seek to understand how zoning laws may increase or decrease factors, such as the cost of rent, income, and home values. Zoning is not the only factor, however. The overall state of the economy and job market are also important to consider.\n\n\nCost Burden for Low Income Residents"

    "text": "Jobs and Vacant Housing\nWe have chosen to represent the availability of housing units as the percent of vacant housing units over the total population. This number provides insight into a given city’s capacity to handle housing demand. This variable is limited because it includes units that are vacant because nobody wants to live in them, but it provides a closer representation of yearly data than housing permits, which represent the growth that will be available in a few years after the housing units are built. We are representing the demand for housing as the percentage of new jobs over the total population for a given city. This is because jobs are frequently what drives growth in a city, and the data is less likely to be skewed by children.\nWe are interested in finding cities that need to change their zoning code or building practices in order to accommodate new growth, so it’s important to first look at the supply and demand in growing cities, which is exactly what the following diagram maps.\n\nThere are five main clusters of cities with larger increases in jobs and lower amounts of vacant housing. In the center of the state, Des Moines, West Des Moines, and surrounding micropolitan areas saw an increase in jobs and lower housing. The same is true for the Eastern parts of the state around Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, as well as the Western section near Omaha."

    "section": "Vacancies in Metropolitan Cities",
    "text": "Vacancies in Metropolitan Cities\n\nThe above shows the percent of vacant housing stock in Iowa’s metropolitan cities. The percentage of vacant housing should be between 5 and 10 percent of a city’s total housing stock.In 2022, all of them fall within the ideal amount of housing to have vacant. Davenport’s vacant housing dropped between 2020 and 2022, putting it at a healthy percent of vacant housing. Sioux City and West Des Moines, in orange, are both within the healthy percent of vacant houses out of the total housing stock, but they are decreasing. Given how close they both are to falling under 5% vacant housing stock, it’s likely that these cities should work to increase the rate at which they build new housing. However, none of the cities are outside the acceptable range, which doesn’t explain the very low percentages of vacant housing stock in the map of Iowa. One reason for this disconnect might be that the areas surrounding metropolitan cities are experiencing percent increases in population greater than that of metropolitan cities.\n\nThe above map shows that metropolitan cities tend not to have vacancy percentages within an acceptable range. The dark blue on the map represents vacancy rates that are lower than ideal. That dark blue appears most frequently around Iowa Metropolitan cities, which implies that those cities are not building houses at a rate that keeps up with demand."

    "text": "Vacancies surrounding Des Moines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Des Moines as a case study, we can see that there is a significant difference between the amount of vacant housing stock in Des Moines compared to the cities surrounding Des Moines. Five percent is shown on the chart as a black line to indicate that anything below the line is outside the acceptable percent of vacant housing. While Des Moines may have more than five percent of its housing stock as vacant, many of its suburbs do not have high enough vacancies. This indicates that people are moving to cities surrounding Des Moines at a rate faster than the housing stock can support. This implies that the suburbs are less prepared to handle the population increase than the metro city.\nThe other cities in an MSA do not have enough data points in each graph to draw a reasonable conclusion as to what is happening there."

As people always say, “data is the new future”, pursuing a major in data science allows me to use my skillset in helping the communities to make better decisions through data. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career as a data scientist in the business and finance field. I am drawn to the intricate patterns and strategic decisions that data can unveil in financial markets and business operations. The ability to analyze complex datasets, uncover trends, and make data-driven decisions excites and motivates me. Also, I hope to be able to help the customers to make better financial decisions, identify frauds, reduce risks based on data-driven insights."

I am familiar with Pandas and Matplotlib using Python to perform data preprocessing, cleaning, analysis and visualization. Working with data in a team setting for the first time was an eye-opening experience as I get to collaborate with students from various background and getting insights and learning from one another. To make full use of my summer, I plan to enroll in several online courses for R and AI to buck up my skills.\n\n\n\nThree skills that I would like to learn from the DSPG program\n\nI would love to gain a deeper understanding on AI and its application on a real-world datasets. I would like to use this program as a stepping stone to allow me to apply AI under the guidance of mentors. Besides AI, I would like to use this opportunity to further enhance my programming skills specifically in Python and R. Lastly, beyond the technical skills, I hope to improve my ability to communicate and explain complex technical data findings to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n\n\nWhy the three skills\n\n\nApplying AI to real-world datasets allows me to understand practical challenges and develop solutions that are impactful and relevant to industry needs more efficiently\nHaving strong programming skills enable me to implement data analysis and visualization effectively as Python and R are one of the primary languages used in data science\nWhile dealing with sophiscated AI models and analyses, having the ability to communicate my findings clearly to stakeholders ensure that my work can be fully utilized and impactful towards the intended audiences\n\n\n\n\nSteps that I would take to improve my skills\n\n\nHave an open mind by experimenting with different data science tools and to seek mentorship from peers\nPratice working on real-world datasets to gain practical experience (participate in DSPG, hackathons)\nPractice presenting my findings through reports, presentations, and visualizations as well as constant engage activity such as public speaking"

I’ve been using an app called todoist to manage the various sorts of tasks that are required of me to complete throughout DSPG. These have included things such as:\n\nDate Reminders and Lists for Scheduling Guest Speakers\nRecurring Tasks for Updating Schedules, Blog Posts, and other Assignments\nOne-off Tasks Focused on Helping the Three Project Tasks\nOutlining Tasks Related to Program Finances and Administration.\n\nHaving a system for being able to categorize and set up dates, priorities, and labels for my tasks has been great for staying on top of the administrative tasks."

In the previous years, the schedule would be a word document on the CyBox, the schedule for talks was tabulated in an excel sheet, and other pieces of information scattered through various systems and directories. Only needing to update a single location for informing students and project advisors who are not always with the group is both efficient and saves a lot of time.\n\n\nGitHub Repositories, Templates, and Classrooms\nIn the interest of having students work on assignments with a mix of datasets, code, and documentation, I’ve constructed all assignments to be GitHub Templates that can be reused for assignment creation in GitHub Classrooms. This has made collecting the work of students significantly easier and has the added bonus of being available for future DSPG programs since they are template repositories. People talk about reproducable code, but reproducible assignments are really where its at!"

As I embark on the DSPG program, I seek to improve my leadership and mentoring capabilities, alongside acquiring new technical expertise. An important goal for me is to refine my communication skills to effectively convey data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, I aim to master the management and extraction of value from extensive real-world datasets, leveraging these skills to make impactful decisions and contributions.\nIn my leisure time, I enjoy listening to music, watching soccer games and playing video games.\n\n\nWhy I Care about Data Science\nI remember the moment I became interested in advanced research in Data Science. It was during my master’s research, where I evaluated the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on chronic kidney disease (CKD). I used propensity score matching to address differences in patient characteristics that might influence SGLT2 prescription. Additionally, I utilized machine learning models to predict CKD cases. Since the dataset was imbalanced, I applied balanced bagging with bootstrapping and synthetic minority oversampling to balance the distribution of CKD and non-CKD cases in the training data. This aimed to facilitate improved learning on the training dataset and enhance predictions on the testing data. The analysis revealed that individuals taking SGLT2 had fewer CKD cases than those who did not, highlighting the protective effect of SGLT2 on CKD. This shows the potential of statistics and data science in extracting meaningful insights from healthcare data.\nHowever, amidst this revelation, a significant issue surfaced - the absence of reliable data for marginalized populations, resulting in disproportionately worse health outcomes. Since then, my focus evolved from merely using models to make predictions to understanding the “why” and “what-if” behind those predictions. I realized that relying solely on supervised models was insufficient for this purpose, prompting me to develop methods that could integrate machine learning and causal approaches to address and explain predictions in imbalanced datasets.\n\n\n\nFigure Reference (Causality for Machine Learning)\n\n\nAs a consequence, I aim to leverage machine learning with causal methods to understand the influence of policies and interventions on diseases outcomes across various data sources. I seek to move from prediction-based models to learning independent causal models in areas like transfer and meta-learning. This approach will aid in integrating diverse healthcare datasets, often compounded by heterogeneous patient characteristics and medical protocols, ensuring the generalizability of my findings against external datasets. Additionally, I aim to create models capable of scaling up datasets to better reflect the diversity of the population. My goal is to enhance model interpretability through counterfactual reasoning and mitigate algorithmic biases for fair and equitable outcomes, ensuring the reliability of healthcare research across different demographics."

I have been always interested in the Transportation problem surrounding me, may be because that’s all I saw. But with time as I am exploring more, I am finding my new interested areas in spatial problems like, housing, accessibility. I am hoping to be focused down in a very near future, as I finished up my semester of masters program this Spring 2024.\n\n\n\nMy Undergrad Convocation from BUET in Urban and Regional Planning\n\n\n\n\nWhat got me into Data Science\nAfter completing my undergrad I had the opportunity to work in the real world for more than a couple of years, in transportation, health care and commodity industry back home. There I got to know the power of data and story telling. You can influence decision through your stories but it has to be backed by data and presented in a comprehensible format and your one little presentation can really changes lives. I can go on giving a number of examples to show how it has motivated me, but I will stop here, and keep my Focus.\nSo, my encounter of Data Science is through excel (you can do a lot of stuff there too) and for spatial one if through GIS (Geographic Information System). I know some basics of SQL, R, Python, but not enough to score good in quiz. But I am betting on my time here and the aim is to have the most productive time this summer 2024 and see the result after 10 weeks. I will come back to share the updates!\n\n\nMy Leisure\nI do not really have any particular talents apart from the academics one, but apart from sleep and watching tv, I love a good conversation of getting to know new people, good food, some cooking, travelling, a little bit of gardening and reading fictions. Pretty ordinary things!"

For example:\n\n\n\nThis makes the data unreliable.\nResolutions: Collect County-level data & Analyse the the margin of errors.\n\n\n\nWe also collect the data for English Proficiency, Commuters and Foreign-born entries. The foreign-born dataset will be used in future work to analyse the relationship with the English Proficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Datasets: Hospital Closures, Birthing Unit Closures\n\nHospital Closures\nAfter collecting and analysing ten datasets of active hospitals from 2015 to 2024, we come to a nice conclusion that there is only one closure.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthing Unit Closures\nTwo counties with two birthing unit closures. Others with zero or one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural & Built Capitals\nThis week, we’ll start looking on the natural & built capitals (infrastructures, etc.)\nSpecifically, we are looking at the number of employments in certain industries, such as: agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, mining. This dataset comes from the ACS and will be used as a measure for natural capitals."

    "text": "Let’s take a look at the future for Ames home-owners.\nVideo\n\nIt appears that suburban areas of Ames have been growing faster in household income then “urban” area’s. But this analysis begs a new question, is the cost of rents increasing in the same area’s? (later will calculate cost of living)\n\nVideo\n\nWe see a different picture when it comes to rent cost. Rent costs seemed to grow evenly across Ames from 2010 - 2020, but 2020-2022 costs around Iowa State have increased a noticeably faster rate then the suburban areas… I started college in 2020!\n\n\nThese two trends bring up many questions about the Ames renting market.\n\n\nA question this may bring up “what is Ames and household income going to look like in 2030?”\n\nVideo\n\nBy looking at my household income forecast map we can see that its likely that the suburban area’s will continue to grow at a faster rate than areas around ISU."

So an example would be ![Stock Photo of a Data Cat](imgs/Data_Cat.png)\n\n\n\nStock Photo of a Data Cat\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image in the yaml, the first image in the post will be used as the thumbnail of the post. A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

Subsequently, we applied various techniques that I learned during the Data Camp sessions. For instance, we implemented Sobel edge detection to highlight edges within the image. we also explored morphological operations to produce an eroded version of the image, which helps in understanding structural elements.

The idea is we want to be gather data at the smallest level we can with hopes of going down to the household level if possible. To do this we looked at two communities of varying sizes to see what level of data is available, Des Moines and Clear Lake.\nStarting with population density this week, we started off at the city level using Census data from the ACS-5 year (2022) to make sure data was available and the results are displayed in the graph below.\n\nSource: US Census ACS-5 (2022)\nFrom there we moved on to see if data was available at the block group and block level, which data was found for population but coming up with density would be a bit time intensive especially in Des Moines. Below is the population density of the block groups in Clear Lake as well as the block layout of Des Moines in which the process of getting population density would be similar yet time consuming.\nClear Lake Block Group Population Density\n Source: US Census ACS-5 (2022)\nDes Moines Block Population\n Source: Us Census 2020 Decennial Data\n\n\n#|echo = FALSE\npopulation_elderly2 &lt;- readRDS(file = \"Data/populationElderly2.RDS\")\n\n\nMoving forward we could look into remote sensing as a possibility to get even smaller data using machine learning.

For the streets, I got data from HUD and used a tool called “Geocodio” to find their exact locations.\nFor small blocks, I looked at where majority of senior age groups live in Des Moines. I used something called Tiger Line to get the Geographic data, I converted the shp file to csv, and I only looked at Des Moines to keep it simple. Then, I combined all this data and used a tool called GeoPandas to organize it better and turn it into a type of map file called GeoJSON.\nNext week, I want to make one function that does all this work.

    "text": "Community Capitals Project Introduction\n\nWhat is a Community and what is a Capital?\nCommunity: A healthy community has all three below\n\nGeography Based(cities, counties, neighborhoods)\nOrganized Based(school, work)\nIdentity Based(Hometown, vacation home)\n\nCapital: An asset that is “invested” to create resources.\n\n\nTypes of Community Capitals\n\nNatural Capital - The quality and quantity of natural and environmental resources existing in a community.\nCultural Capital - The values, norms, beliefs and traditions that people inherit from the family, school and community. Also includes material goods produced at a specific time and place (such as paintings, books) that have historical or cultural significance.\nHuman Capital - Attributes of individuals that provide them with the ability to earn a living, strengthen community, and otherwise contribute to community organizations, to their families, and to self- improvement (Flora et al. 2004). It includes access to education and knowledge development, training and skill building activities and efforts to build and expand local leadership.\nSocial Capital - Connections existing among people and organizations that help make things happen in the community. Includes close ties that build community cohesion (bonding) as well as weaker ties with local and outside people and organizations that help promote broad-based action on key matters (bridging).\nPolitical Capital - The ability to influence and enforce rules, regulations, and standards. Access to individuals and groups with the power to influence decisions. Participating in civic discourse on difficult public issues.\nFinancial Capital - The variety of financial resources available to invest in local projects or economic development initiatives. Efforts to build wealth to support community development activities.\nBuilt Capital - Represents the infrastructure of the community – the basic set of facilities, services and physical structures needed by a community.\n\n\n\nProject Goal\nCurrently, we are seeking measurements that might influence these forms of capital and reliable data sources for them. For example, a measurement could be the number of businesses per county, which could significantly impact financial capital.\nPrevious projects have identified numerous measures for capitals such as Built, Financial, and Natural, but have found limited measures for Social and Cultural capital. This is because social and cultural aspects are challenging to quantify and collect data on, unlike Financial capital, which is inherently numerical.\nGoal in the future, gather diverse measurements and data sets for each type of capital, we aim to develop an index value representing each capital for each county in Iowa to visualize."

    "text": "Social & Cultural Capitals\n\nBeginning\nThroughout this week we have been brainstorming ways that we can measure Social and Cultural Capital. We read articles and looked at websites to gain knowledge on potential measures. As we started our research, we wrote down measure ideas along the way. We discussed some of our ideas and talked about our concerns of the project so far. Our biggest concern was finding cultural measures.\n\n\nSocial Capitals:\n\nVolunteering rates\nParticipation in Civic Acts/Election turnout\nParticipation frequency in Clubs/ Communities\nCrime rates\nNumber of visits to the public library and the programs\nDonations to local candidate committees and ballot issue committees\n\n\n\nCultural Capitals:\n\nArt festival/ cultural events turnout\nMembership of cultural organizations\nNumber of distinct religions represented\nFrequency of attendance at religion services\n\n\n\nFindings\nWe found that it is much easier to think of social capitals compared to cultural capitals. The tricky part about Cultural Capitals is being able to find datasets for our measures. For example, a community could have a lot of cultural capital due to holding cultural events but there is very little or no data for us to look at.\nSome of the sources that we have found so far are:\n\nAmeriCorps\n\nInformation about volunteering and civic life\n\nSocial Capital Atlas\n\nInformation about economic connectedness, cohesiveness, and civic engagement\n\nIowa Campaign Contributions Received\n\nInformation about political campaigns (committee, contribution amount, city)\n\nIowa Public Library Statistics\n\nInformation about the public libraries in Iowa counties"

    "text": "Events Database\n\nFEMA Dataset\nThe Federal Management Agency(FEMA) disasters dataset includes various disasters/events that have taken place throughout the United States over the years. These datasets also include all the grants and funding approved by various organizations.\n\nArea Dataset\n\n# import pandas as pd\n# areas_df = pd.read_csv(\"Data/Updated_FEMA_Disaster_Areas.csv\")\n# areas_df\n\nArea Dataset Feature Selection:\n\nid: Not needed\ndisasterNumber: Might be important, will keep it for now.\nprogramTypeCode: Redundant, this info is available in programTypeDescription\nprogramTypeDescription: Will keep\nstateCode: Will either keep this or stateName but will drop one of them\nstateNames: Same as stateCode\nplaceCode: Keep for now\nplaceName: Most seems to be based on county but need to get rid of the ‘(county)’ part.\ndesignatedDate: Convert to Date type and clean up\nentryDate: Convert to Date type and clean up\nupdateDate: Convert to Date type and clean up\ncloseoutDate: Convert to Date type and clean up\nhash: not needed\nlastRefresh: Not important\n\n\n\nAmounts & Declarations Dataset\nSimilar feature selection process was applied to these datasets as well.\nAmounts Dataset\n\n# import pandas as pd\n# amounts_df = pd.read_csv(\"Data/FEMA_Disaster_Amounts.csv\")\n# amounts_df\n\nDeclarations Dataset\n\n# dec_df = pd.read_csv(\"Data/FEMA_Disaster_Declarations.csv\")\n\n\n#Dropping mostly dates, state and county code which are available in the Areas dataset\n# decColumnsToDrop = dec_df.columns[[0,2,3,4,5,7,12,13,14,16,17,20,21,22,23,24]]\n# dec_df = dec_df.drop(columns=decColumnsToDrop)\n# dec_df\n\nGoal next week:\nSince all three datasets include the column ‘districtNumber’ that match with each other, I plan to join these datasets into a new datasets which will follow a similar format.\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Shocks\nWe will be working with the Employment Shocks Data. The data is from workforce iowa.gov and LayoffData.com. The purpose of looking at employment shocks can help explain a communities well being. For example in the Tyson Food plants closure in Parry, Iowa will have a huge impact on it’s community. 1,276 people will be losing their job. As we started to look the datasets we found that there are three different notice types: Amendment, Mass Layoff, Closing, and Workforce reduction. we found that there were some miss spellings or slight character differences between the name of the companies and cities. Her next steps are to continue cleaning the data, fix the values so that they match up with each other, and start making visualizations.\n\n# Read in the data set\nWARN_2005_2024 &lt;- read.csv(\"Data/WARN_2005_2024.csv\")\n# WARN_2005_2024$`WARN Received Date` &lt;- as.POSIXct(WARN_2005_2024$`WARN Received Date`, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n# WARN_2005_2024$`Effective Date` &lt;- as.POSIXct(WARN_2005_2024$`Effective Date`, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Variables\nW05_24_V &lt;- WARN_2005_2024[ ,-c(8,9,10,13)]\n\n\n# Unique values\nsort(unique(WARN_2005_2024$`Company`))\nsort(unique(WARN_2005_2024$`City`))\nunique(WARN_2005_2024$`Notice Type`)\nsort(unique(WARN_2005_2024$`County`))\n\n\n\n\nHealth\nWe believe that there are some indirect correlations between health facilities and social capitals, especially the establishments and closures of health facilities in some specific areas leading to changes in capitals.\nThat’s why we collect and analyse data sources regarding nursing homes. We have 3 datasets:\n\nNursing Homes from CMS, consisting of 100 columns and 14,860 observations\nIowa Medicaid Payments with 9 columns and 98,305 observations representing the Medicaid reports\nNursing Facility Closures includes data for facilities that closed in 2023\n\nand 9 datasets for nursing homes from 2015 to 2022, which will be used to identify the facility closures.\nIllustrations:\n\ncms_nursinghome_df = read.csv(\"Data/CMS_Nursing_Homes.csv\")\ncolnames(cms_nursinghome_df) &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\.\", \" \", colnames(cms_nursinghome_df))\nhead(cms_nursinghome_df)\n\n\n\n\nElephant\n\n\n\nmedicaid_df = read.csv(\"Data/Iowa_Medicaid_Payments.csv\")\ncolnames(medicaid_df) &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\.\", \" \", colnames(medicaid_df))\ncolnames(medicaid_df)[colnames(medicaid_df) == \"Vendor Name\"] &lt;- \"Provider Name\"\ncolnames(medicaid_df)[colnames(medicaid_df) == \"Vendor Number\"] &lt;- \"Provider Number\"\nhead(medicaid_df)\n\n\n\n\nElephant\n\n\n\nclosure_df = readxl::read_excel(\"Data/Nursing_Facility_Closures.xlsx\")\nhead(closure_df)\n\n\n\n\nElephant\n\n\nFirst approach: We want to identify the opening and closing dates for each provider, so our first approach is to utilize the “Report Date” column in the medicaid dataset. Whenever a payment is made to a provider, a report will be recorded. So we first used the most recent report date and the oldest report date as estimates for the opening and closing dates, but…\n\nmedicaid_df_latest_filtered &lt;- medicaid_df %&gt;%\n                          group_by(`Provider Name`) %&gt;%\n                          summarise(estimate_closing = max(`Report Date`))\nmedicaid_df_oldest_filtered &lt;- medicaid_df %&gt;%\n                          group_by(`Provider Name`) %&gt;%\n                          summarise(estimate_opening = min(`Report Date`))\nopening_closing_medicaid &lt;- medicaid_df_latest_filtered %&gt;%\n                              full_join(medicaid_df_oldest_filtered, by = \"Provider Name\") %&gt;%\n                              select(`Provider Name`, `estimate_opening`, `estimate_closing`)\nopening_closing_medicaid\n\n\n\n\nElephant\n\n\nSecond approach: We collect 9 additional datasets regarding active providers from 2015 to 2022, and compare the consecutive years to estimate the year a provider closes. Illustrations are below: \nSo by looking at this planned dataframe, we can estimate the provider with ID 1506000 closed in 2018 and use that insight to identify the effect of the closure on the community."

    "text": "Social and Cultural Capital Datasets\n\nFBI Crime Reports\nWe worked with the FBI Crime Reports dataset which consisted all the crimes reported in the year of 2021 for all offenses. There are a total of fifty different offenses in the dataset, but we primarily focused on four which were classified as the most violent crimes:\n\nMurder: 11(Non-negligent)\nForcible Rape: 20\nRobbery: 30\nAggravated Assault: 40\n\nWe believed that these four in particular could be a strong measure for social capital. High rates of such crimes might indicate low levels of social cohesion, trust, and mutual aid among community members, which are key components of social capital.\nThe dataset initially consisted over 78 columns, with a lot of redundant columns but also followed a ‘wide’ format which was very hard to read, especially when trying to see the demographics on who committed the crime.\n\nWe then transformed this from a wide format to a long format, and we kept the total crime count for each offense in each county, as well as the crime count per 10k population. This way we have much less columns, and we can extract important crime information for each offense in each county much easier.\n For most of our datasets, we are trying to follow a format where in each county level dataset we have all the 99 different counties in the ‘COUNTY’ column, this way, it is much easier when merging datasets for our final data visualization.\n\n\n\nSocial Capital Atlas\nAlong with the FBI Crime Reports dataset, we looked into Meta’s Social Capital Atlas dataset, a very cool website that shows the social engagement of a community on their social media platform.\nDifferent measures for social capital in this dataset:\n\nConnectedness: How people with different characteristics and backgrounds are friends with each other, this is a clear example of bridging social capital.\nCohesiveness: The degree to which friendship networks are clustered into cliques and whether friendships tend to be supported by mutual friends. This includes our clustering and support ratio measures.\nCivic Engagement: Indices of trust or participation in civic organizations. This includes our volunteering rate measure.\n\n\nEconomic Connectedness by County\n\nNext week goal: We have the same dataset but by zip code instead and we would like to generate maps for each variable by zip code.\n\n\nIowa Public Library Statistics\nWe looked at the Iowa Public Library Statistics for the fiscal year 2023, July 1, 2022 - Jun 30, 2023. There were 514 Libraries in the dataset and each library was set to a size range. The main sections that we looked at were expenditures, programs and activities, services, and transactions. This will tell us how involved a community is to their public library.\n\n\nProgram and Activities\n\n\n    City  Pop Size Prog1 Attend1 Prog2 Attend2 Prog3 Attend3 Prog4 Attend4 Prog5 Attend5 Prog6 Attend6 Num Programs per 10,000 People Num of Attend per Pop Total Kid Programs Num Kid Programs per 10,000 People Total Kid Programs Attend Num of Kid Programs Attend per 10,000 People\n1 Ackley 1699    C     5      28    46    1106     0       0    68     379    12     441   131    1954                       771.0418             1.1500883                 51                          300.17657                      1134                                     6674.514\n2  Adair  828    B     0       0     5     245     0       0     1      10     6     150    12     405                       144.9275             0.4891304                  5                           60.38647                       245                                     2958.937\n3   Adel 6090    E   143    2638    37     719    33     397   327    1902    35    1635   575    7291                       944.1708             1.1972085                180                          295.56650                      3357                                     5512.315\n4 Agency  463    B     0       0    11      56     0       0    12      40     0       0    23      96                       496.7603             0.2073434                 11                          237.58099                        56                                     1209.503\n5  Akron 1580    C    40     980    32    1353     4      72    55     407    25     878   156    3690                       987.3418             2.3354430                 72                          455.69620                      2333                                    14765.823\n\n\nIn this table we added columns to find out the number of programs and attendance per 10,000 people in each city.
