    "section": "Linking Pages and Images",
    "text": "Linking Pages and Images\nYou can link items in your files by using the following syntax [Text of Link](Link Reference - URL). Referencing also works for adding images into your blogs. The syntax is very similar, but requires an ! in the front. So an example would be ![Stock Photo of a Data Cat](imgs/Data_Cat.png)\n\n\n\nStock Photo of a Data Cat\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image in the yaml, the first image in the post will be used as the thumbnail of the post. A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "title": "Blog Writing Guidelines",
    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

    "text": "Using Other Languages\nThe last thing we will look at is displaying code for languages other than R. RMarkdown files have the ability to change the rendering engine so that other languages can also be used. To run Python, you will have to have the reticulate library installed and configured. When you’ve created a code chunk, you will want to switch the section that is typically in the form of {r} to {python} or whatever other supported language you wish to use.\nHere is a Python code block.\n\nimport platform\n\nprint(\"This code is run using python version\", platform.python_version())\n\nThis code is run using python version 3.9.18"

This is how I stumbled across the DSPG program and applied to be a graduate fellow for summer of 2022. I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."
